## 🌟 Features

- 🧠 **ML-Powered Predictions**  
  Detects potential CKD using trained machine learning models on clinical data.

- 🩺 **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Built with React and TailwindCSS for a responsive and clean UI.

- 🔍 **Step-by-Step Flow**  
  Guided input form, real-time prediction, and risk level output.

- 🔐 **Privacy Focused**  
  No personal data stored. Just accurate predictions with full transparency.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **ML Model:** Scikit-learn (Random Forest) trained on real clinical datasets  
- **Hosting:** Vercel (Frontend), Render/Heroku (Backend API)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Input Clinical Data** — Users enter values like glucose, blood pressure, creatinine, etc.
2. **Prediction Engine** — Backend API processes data and predicts CKD risk using ML.
3. **Risk Output** — A confidence score and risk category are displayed.
4. **Guidance** — Recommendations on whether to seek medical consultation.
